/**
   * Portable Interceptors Current (also known as <code>PICurrent</code>) 
   * is merely a slot table, the slots of which are used by each service to 
   * transfer their context data between their context and the request's or 
   * reply's service context. Each service which wishes to use PICurrent 
   * reserves a slot or slots at initialization time and uses those slots 
   * during the processing of requests and replies.
   * <p>
   * Before an invocation is made, PICurrent is obtained via a call to 
   * <code>ORB.resolve_initial_references( "PICurrent" )</code>. From within 
   * the interception points, the data on PICurrent that has moved from the 
   * thread scope to the request scope is available via the 
   * <code>get_slot</code> operation on the <code>RequestInfo</code> object. 
   * A PICurrent can still be obtained via 
   * <code>resolve_initial_references</code>, but that is the Interceptor's 
   * thread scope PICurrent.
